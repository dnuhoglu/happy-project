## Project Definition

# Data

In the previous years, the World Happiness Report has been published, which contains the results of several surveys conducted on people from 155 countries. In the survey, people ranked their happiness in different areas (Economy, Family, Life Expectancy, etc.) from 0 to 10, where higher scores mean higher levels of satisfaction. The report includes results from 155 different countries and their mean happiness score, as well as the standard deviation.

# Motivation

The aim of the project is to determine what Turkish people think about their countries current situation. For each of the last three years, we can look at the happiness score of Turkey and compare it to others to find how well Turkey is doing among other countries. Moreover, by looking at the percentages, we can observe how the happiness rank of Turkey changes in the world.
